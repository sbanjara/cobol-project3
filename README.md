# COBOL Project3
  This is a COBOL program which accepts an input file which contains the inventory records of a company which manufactures candies.
  It then outputs a detailed inventory report of this company. It was one of the projects of my CS-370 (COBOL) class. This program
  processes input file as outlined in program3-description and outputs the detailed report as outlined in program3-printer-spacing-chart.
